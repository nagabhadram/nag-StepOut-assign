cors: Middleware for enabling CORS
jsonwebtoken: Library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens
Frontend:

axios: HTTP client for making API requests
react-router-dom: Routing library for React
Notes
Ensure that the backend server (server.js) is running before starting the frontend.
Adjust API URLs and configurations as necessary based on your environment.
